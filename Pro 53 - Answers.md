2. HTML

3. The `<div>` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

   The `<div>` tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

   The `<div>` tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

   Any sort of content can be put inside the `<div>` tag! 

4. [**Relative Position:**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-positioning-elements/) Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with *position: relative;* property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.

   [**Absolute Position:**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-positioning-elements/#:~:text=An element with position%3A absolute, which are at same level.) An element with *position: absolute;* will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent. If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.

5. The `opacity` property sets the opacity level for an element.

   The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent.

   For seeing the output on the device emulator in the browser, you have to press "Tap to play". You might have to wait in a queue as there are many systems online using a common emulator.

9. A render function can return only one React Component. If there are more than one React Components that need to be returned, they should be nested inside View.

10. Whatever a function component returns is rendered as a React element. React elements let you describe what you want to see on the screen.
